# Optimization of Food Accessibility in Allegheny County
## Project Motivation

Food insecurity is a critical socio-economic issue affecting approximately 24 million households in the U.S. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves as a vital resource for low-income Americans, yet access to SNAP-accepting stores remains a challenge, particularly for individuals with limited transportation options. This project focuses on Allegheny County, where food insecurity is a significant concern. We hypothesized that identifying areas with higher SNAP-eligible populations and longer average walk times to SNAP-accepting stores would enable the SNAP Policy Division within the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to advocate more effectively for additional resources in these communities.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA to understand the demographics and distribution of SNAP-eligible populations in Allegheny County.
   - Analyzed two key themes: areas with high SNAP eligibility based on income levels and the distribution of stores that accept Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards.
   - Created a choropleth map to visually compare EBT-accepting vs. non-EBT stores.

2. **Network Analysis:**
   - Performed a network analysis to calculate walk and drive times to the nearest grocery stores that accept EBT cards.
   - Identified areas with limited access to EBT-accepting stores, focusing on communities with higher transportation barriers.

3. **Segmentation and Prioritization:**
   - Developed a segmentation matrix to categorize census tracts into high, medium, and low priority based on SNAP eligibility and walk times to the nearest EBT-accepting store.
   - Highlighted top three high-priority census tracts (1610, 1306, and 5623), characterized by long walk times to EBT-accepting stores and high SNAP-eligible populations.

## Results and Recommendations
1. **Walk Time Analysis:**
   - Mapped the walk times to the nearest EBT-accepting stores, highlighting high-priority census tracts where residents face significant barriers to food access.

2. **Priority Segmentation:**
   - Created a matrix to identify high, medium, and low-priority tracts, focusing on those with high SNAP eligibility and extended travel times.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Proposed targeted interventions in census tracts 1610, 1306, and 5623, which lack sufficient EBT-accepting stores within a 10 to 15-minute walk radius.
